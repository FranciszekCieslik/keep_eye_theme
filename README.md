# Keep Eye
Keep Eye is my own visual studio code theme.

I based my project on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGzssFNtWXw)
## Installation
Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.
```Microsoft Visual Studio Solution
ext install HupanCoder.keep-eye-theme
```

**Enjoy!** ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
